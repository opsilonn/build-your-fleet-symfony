# Project PHP / MySQL - Build your Fleet

## ...But why ?

This project was made in september 2018, when I was in my 3rd year at Efrei.
During my semester abroad at MAHE (Manipal, India), we had to make a project in PHP and MySQL.
Since I didn't want to make a basis project, like buy some items, or manage a library... I made a project where I buy some spaceships. Well, it ain't much, but it's honest work.


It's globally improved over the previous version : the Login / Signin is operational, you can edit your data and see spaceships...
What remains for the moment is :
- order a spaceship
- see your previous order
- maybe indicate a counter for your fleet ? Like, what would be its size / its prize ? Might be funny to implement...
