###Project PHP / MySQL - Build your Fleet

## ...But why ?

This project was made in september 2018, when I was in my 3rd year at Efrei.
During my semester abroad at MAHE (Manipal, India), we had to make a project in PHP and MySQL.
Since I didn't want to make a basis project, like buy some items, or manage a library... I made a project where I buy some spaceships. Well, it ain't much, but it's honest work.


There are a ot of unfinished stuff : you can order or add spaceships.
The login works (I think), but I'm not sure for the creation of User.
